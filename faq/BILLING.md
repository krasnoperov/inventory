# Billing FAQ

## How does billing work?

We use a **usage-based billing model** powered by [Polar](https://polar.sh). This means you only pay for what you use, with clear limits and transparent tracking.

### Your Plan Includes:

- **Monthly usage allowances** for AI features (Claude chat, image generation)
- **Real-time usage tracking** so you always know where you stand
- **Automatic renewal** at the start of each billing cycle

## Understanding Your Usage

### Where can I see my usage?

Visit your **Profile** page to view the **Billing** section. Here you'll find:

- Your current plan name
- Usage meters showing how much you've consumed vs. your limit
- Visual progress bars with color-coded status
- Your renewal date

### What do the usage colors mean?

| Color | Status | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Green | OK | You have plenty of usage remaining |
| Yellow | Getting Low | You've used over 70% of your allowance |
| Orange | Almost Full | You've used over 90% of your allowance |
| Red | Limit Reached | You've reached your limit for this period |

### What happens when I reach my limit?

When you hit your usage limit, that feature will be temporarily unavailable until:
- Your billing cycle resets (usage allowances renew monthly), or
- You upgrade to a higher tier with more allowance

You'll see a friendly message explaining the situation and suggesting an upgrade if needed.

## What Gets Tracked?

### AI Chat (Claude)

Every conversation with the AI assistant uses tokens. We track:
- **Input tokens** — the messages you send
- **Output tokens** — the AI's responses

Longer conversations use more tokens. The token count depends on the complexity and length of your prompts and responses.

### Image Generation

Each image you generate counts toward your image generation limit. Usage is tracked per image created.

## Common Questions

### Why was I charged?

Charges occur at the start of each billing cycle for your subscription. Visit the customer portal via "Manage Billing" to see detailed invoice history.

### Is my payment information secure?

Yes. All payment processing is handled by Polar, a secure payment platform. We never see or store your credit card details.

### Can I get a refund?

Refund policies are managed through Polar. Contact support through the customer portal for refund requests.

### What if I don't want to pay?

You can use the free tier with basic usage limits. When you reach the free tier limits, you can choose to upgrade or wait for the next month when limits reset.

### I'm having billing issues. Who do I contact?

For billing-related issues:
1. First, check the customer portal via "Manage Billing" for answers
