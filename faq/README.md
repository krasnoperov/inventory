# Forge User Guide

This directory contains user-facing documentation for Inventory Forge.

## Getting Started

### [Image Generation Guide](./image-generation-guide.md)
Learn how to create, refine, and combine images using the Forge. Covers basic concepts, operations (generate, refine, combine, fork), tips for better prompts, working with spatial relationships, and building up complex designs step by step.

## Assistant Features

### [Trust Zones](./trust-zones.md)
Control how the AI assistant executes actions. Safe operations run automatically, while generating operations require your approval. Learn how to configure trust settings and use the approval panel.

### [Memory & Personalization](./memory-personalization.md)
The assistant learns from your successful prompts to provide better suggestions over time. Manage your learned patterns, set style preferences, and configure personalization settings.

## Planned Features

### Autonomous Workflows
Multi-step plans with checkpointing and rollback capabilities. The assistant will be able to execute complex creative workflows while tracking progress and allowing you to undo any step.

See: [Implementation Plan](../docs/AUTONOMOUS_WORKFLOWS_PLAN.md)

### Batch Operations
Queue multiple generation jobs and manage them as a group. Create collections of assets, monitor progress, and pause/resume batch operations.

See: [Implementation Plan](../docs/BATCH_OPERATIONS_PLAN.md)
