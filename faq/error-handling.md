# Usage Limits & Errors

This guide explains what happens when you reach your usage limits while using the Forge Assistant.

## Monthly Quota

Each plan includes a monthly allowance for AI features. When you've used your entire quota, you'll see:

> "Monthly quota exceeded. Please upgrade your plan."

**What you'll see in the chat:**
- Your current usage (e.g., "You've used 50,000 of your 50,000 monthly tokens")
- An **Upgrade Plan** button

**What to do:**
1. Click **Upgrade Plan** to view subscription options in the billing portal
2. Or wait until the start of your next billing cycle when your quota resets

Your quota resets automatically at the beginning of each billing period. Check your Profile page to see your renewal date.

## Rate Limiting

To ensure fair usage for everyone, there's a limit on how many requests you can make per minute. If you're working too quickly, you'll see:

> "Too many requests. Please wait..."

**What you'll see in the chat:**
- A countdown timer showing seconds until you can try again
- A progress bar that fills as the wait time passes

**What to do:**
- Simply wait for the countdown to finish
- When it shows "Ready to try again", you can continue working

Rate limits reset every 60 seconds, so you won't have to wait long.

## Other Errors

### Network Errors
If you see "Network error", check your internet connection and try again.

### Service Unavailable
If the AI service is temporarily unavailable, wait a moment and retry. The assistant will offer a "Retry" button for these errors.

### Session Expired
If you see "Session expired", refresh the page and sign in again.

## Tips to Avoid Limits

1. **Work thoughtfully** - Review each generation before requesting another
2. **Use refinements** - Refining an existing image often uses fewer resources than generating from scratch
3. **Plan your workflow** - The assistant can help you plan multi-step operations efficiently
